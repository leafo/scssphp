# scssphp v0.0.5
### <http://leafo.net/scssphp>

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/leafo/scssphp.png)](http://travis-ci.org/leafo/scssphp)

`scssphp` is a compiler for SCSS written in PHP.

It implements SCSS 3.2.7. It does not implement the SASS syntax, only the SCSS
syntax.

Checkout the homepage, <http://leafo.net/scssphp>, for directions on how to use.

## Running Tests

`scssphp` uses [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit) for testing.

Run the following command from the root directory to run every test:

    phpunit tests

There are two kinds of tests in the `tests/` directory:

* `ApiTest.php` contains various unit tests that test the PHP interface.
* `ExceptionTest.php` contains unit tests that test for exceptions thrown by the parser and compiler.
* `InputTest.php` compiles every `.scss` file in the `tests/inputs` directory
  then compares to the respective `.css` file in the `tests/outputs` directory.

When changing any of the tests in `tests/inputs`, the tests will most likely
fail because the output has changed. Once you verify that the output is correct
you can run the following command to rebuild all the tests:

    BUILD=true phpunit tests

This will compile all the tests, and save results into `tests/outputs`.
